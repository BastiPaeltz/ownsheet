## to extension developers

Feel free to port ownsheet to Firefox, Safari or whatever you like and publish it (under your name).  
This should actually be not that hard, since the only Chrome-specific API ownsheet is using is <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction">browser action</a> for the popup.  
All I'm asking is that you link back or mention the original ownsheet.
